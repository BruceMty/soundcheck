soundcheck is for helping find feedback issues when performing a sound check
at a sound board by:
  1) Displaying a spectrogram of audio from the sound board
     useful for finding feedback frequencies.
  2) Generating white noise or a specific frequency for the sound board
     useful for finding feedback frequencies.

soundcheck is currently under development.
soundcheck is intended to be available for Windows, Linux, and Mac users.


Downloads and Websites
----------------------
Please see the soundcheck Wiki home page
at https://github.com/BruceMty/soundcheck/wiki


Downloading the Development Tree
--------------------------------
Download the sources with git:

  $ git clone https://github.com/BruceMty/soundcheck.git


Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
A development envirnment and libraries are required.  The following steps
install requisite dependencies on Fedora 19.

   $ sudo yum update
   $ sudo yum groupinstall development-tools
   $ sudo yum install portaudio-devel
   $ sudo yum install wxGTK-devel

maybe, for alsa:
   $ sudo yum install libasound-devel


Compiling soundcheck
----------------
soundcheck builds with the GNU auto tools. The maintainer has
prevously run automake and autoconf to produce the script
"configure". This script *should* be able to compile soundcheck
for your platform. 

You can disable all optimization flags by specifying the
configure option --with-noopt.

To install on a Linux/MacOS system, use:
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

If you do not wish to run sudo, please install soundcheck on linux/MacOS
under $HOME/local as follows:
   $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/ --exec-prefix=$HOME/local CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib/
   $ make
   $ install

The following files are installed:
   bin/soundcheck


Installing
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to install at default paths, which requires sudo, type this:
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

If you wish to install at $HOME/local, which does not require sudo, type this:
   $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/ --exec-prefix=$HOME/local CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib/
   $ make
   $ install

================================================================

To cross-compile from Fedora 19 to Windows, do the following:
   1) Set up the mingw cross compiler environment:
      $ cd src_win; ./CONFIGURE_F19.sh; cd ..
   2) type "make win32" or "make win64", or to create a windows
      installer, type "cd src_win; make".


Install on ubuntu using apt-get.

Install on Mac using MacPorts:

  $ sudo port install autoconf automake portaudio-devel wxGTK-devel libasound-devel

Note that port installs to /opt/local/bin, so file /etc/paths may need to be updated
to include /opt/local/bin.
